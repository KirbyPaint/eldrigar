## Known Bugs

Not even close to a finished site. There are probably bugs.\
You can access the site here: https://kirbypaint.github.io/eldrigar/

The attached PDF has a notable bug in the Skills portion. If a skill has no points placed, please enter a 0 in that field.\
The current code adds the fields across; however, if a field is blank, it will concatenate the fields as STRINGS instead of INTEGERS.\
This means that the numbers get stacked together in a row, instead of added together properly.\
Example: A skill with no points value entered, plus a modifier of '2', plus a miscellaneous bonus of '0', will read literally as ' 20' instead of adding nothing, plus two, plus zero.\
I am pretty sure the Saving Throws also do this sometimes.
